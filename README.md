# 🚦 Traffic Signal Management System

This project simulates an **AI-powered traffic signal management system** that uses computer vision to detect vehicles and control traffic signals.  
It helps in reducing congestion by adjusting traffic light timing dynamically based on real-time video input.

---

## 📌 Features
- Vehicle detection using **OpenCV** and Haar cascades (`cars.xml`).
- Supports multiple lane video inputs (`laneA.mp4`, `laneB.mp4`, etc.).
- Real-time dashboard (`dashboard.py`) to visualize traffic flow.
- Demo videos included (`demo.mp4`) for testing.
- Can be extended for smart city applications.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV** (for image & video processing)
- **Streamlit / Tkinter** (for dashboard visualization, optional)
- **NumPy**
